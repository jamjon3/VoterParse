This is a bit of code to handle importing the raw voter base file into 
a database so extracts and further breakdowns can be processed from the 
database.

Currently, this functions only by running this via command-line.
I'm stubbing out an interface and the ajax callback to drive it
so this will, ultimately, have an interface.

Configuration options and defaults in the settings.ini file.
