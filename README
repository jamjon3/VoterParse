This is a bit of code to handle importing the raw voter base file into 
a database so extracts and further breakdowns can be processed from the 
database.

Currently, running this command-line is the mechanism for running this.
Configuration options are setup in the setup.ini file. I'm stubbing
the code for a formal web interface but that will come later.
